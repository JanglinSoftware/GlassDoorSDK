	<h1>Glassdoor .NET SDK</h1>
	<h2>by Janglin Software</h2>
	<h4>Version 1.0.3</h4>
	<p>
		A .NET-based SDK for the Glassdoor API which separates HTTP request overhead from business logic and front end formatting. Optimized for application development, the creation of URLs, HTTP Requests, managing of paginated responses and even HTTP exceptions are all managed by this SDK so you can get on with your XAML based app development.
	</p>
	<p>Please review the <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/developer/index.htm" title="Glassdoor API Documentation">Glassdoor API Documentation</a>.</p>

	<h2>Best Practices</h2>
	<p>When at all possible, use the search capability of the API to filter what data you're looking for. Avoid filtering responses with LINQ after the request has been made to keep request responses brief.</p>
	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	<h3>Why are most methods asychronous?</h3>
	<p>Use of asychronous methods allows other work to be done while waiting for the HTTP request to complete. The .NET Threading Task library makes this easy.</p>
	<h3>Why are some methods not asychronous?</h3>
	<p>Some method are not asychnronous because they return collections of data that are continuously concatenated from paged responses. Large collections of data are typically paged where information regarding how many records and how many pages and therefore how many more HTTP requests will be needed to retrieve all of the data are returned with the actual data. Some methods return a collection with a custom enumerator which will keep track of the pagination, whether more data is available and then retrieve that data seamlessly until no more pages are available. This helps app developers worry more about binding to a single collection without having to worry about whether there is more data in more pages and then having to process a new HTTP request.</p>
